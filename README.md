This is a simple application that will help you calculate the cost of buying a car at auctions in Japan, including all necessary costs such as
	delivery within Japan,
	freight to Vladivostok,
	payment for temporary storage,
	brokerage fees, customs duties,
	laboratory fees and delivery to your desired city in Russia.
The programme has several levels of settings: regular and advanced, which can be accessed only after completing the free user registration.
I will also add a function for saving user-calculated options to expedite the search process and enhance the analytics capabilities.
